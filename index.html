            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I am a software engineering student who is passionate about technology and content creation. As a student of software engineering, technology and content creation are my two great loves. My initiatives, successes, and experiences that reflect my abilities and interests in both sectors are displayed in this portfolio. I appreciate you taking the time to look at my work.</p>

            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>Since my first day of college, I have participated in a variety of societies and groups, both technical and non-technical, and I have worked on a variety of soft and hard skills, including organizing, public speaking, and a variety of technical languages and frameworks. I have also worked with some startups, where I was exposed to the culture of starting from nothing and constructing something from zero to one.</p>

            <h2>Skills</h2>
            <p>I have worked on both technical and non-technical skills as a software engineering student and content creation, such as learning different tech languages and frameworks, working on video editing projects for clients, and managing social media.</p>
